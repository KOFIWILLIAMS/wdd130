    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3> Purpose </h3>
    <p>I am creating a website for a local tourist center in my town. The name of the tourist center is called
      Odweanoma, there is a tall mountain which they fly parashot over there. During every easter festivity, there are a
      lot of tourists who come around to participate. So I want to create a website for them which will help in terms of
      advertisement and also people will get more information about the tourist site.
      My site is going to be more advanced, and all various device is going to access it without any interactions.
      Some of the questions were, how am I going to get information about the place, and is it going to be a free site?

    <h3>What is Kwahu known for </h3>
    Kwahu refers to an area and group of people that live in Ghana,
    part of the Twi-speaking Akan group. The region has been dubbed
    Asaase Aban, or the Natural Fortress, in view of its position as the
    highest habitable elevation in the country.
    The Kwahu are well known for the funerary ceramics found by archaeologists.
    Woodcarving includes stools, which are recognized as "seats" of power, and
    akua ba (wooden dolls) that are associated with fertility. There are also
    extensive traditions of pottery and weaving throughout Akan territory.

    <h3>Paragliding Festival</h3>
    The Ghana Tourism Authority in an attempt to promote domestic tourism,
    launched the Kwahu Easter Paragliding Festival at Atibie in Kwahu in 2005.
    This festival is an annual event which is held during every Easter in the
    month of April. During the event, seasoned pilots are invited to
    participate and thousands of people visit Odweano Mountain at Kwahu Atibie.
